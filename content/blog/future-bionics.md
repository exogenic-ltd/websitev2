## The Role of 3D Printing
Additive manufacturing has changed the game entirely. What once took weeks of custom fabrication can now be accomplished in days.

- **Speed:** Custom-fitted sockets printed in hours.
- **Cost:** Material costs reduced by up to 90%.
- **Customization:** Perfectly tailored to the individual.
- **Materials:** Carbon-fiber infused PLA offers high strength.
