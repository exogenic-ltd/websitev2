**Flagship Prosthetic Device**

Our flagship project aimed at democratizing access to advanced prosthetics. By utilizing 3D printing and off-the-shelf components, we have reduced the cost from $50,000 to under $500 while maintaining essential functionality.

- **Cost:** < $500 USD
- **Battery Life:** 12 Hours
- **Type:** Trans-radial Myoelectric

## Key Features
- **EMG Control:** Uses surface electromyography sensors to detect muscle impulses.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Provides vibration feedback to the user when gripping objects.
- **Modular Design:** Fingers and palm components can be easily replaced if damaged.
- **Power:** 12 hours of continuous use on a single charge.

## Technical Specs
### Hardware
- Custom PCB with EMG signal processing.
- 5 individual servo motors for finger control.
- Force-sensitive resistors for grip feedback.
- 2200mAh rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack.

### Software
- Modified Arduino framework.
- Custom algorithms for signal noise reduction.
- Machine learning models to adapt to muscle patterns.
